**This project is a work in progress under active heavy development. It is not production (or even alpha) ready! Follow for updates!**

Gort is a chatbot framework designed from the ground up for chatops.

Gort brings the power of the command line to the place you collaborate with your team: your chat window. Its open-ended command bundle support allows developers to implement functionality in the language of their choice, while powerful access control means you can collaborate around even the most sensitive tasks with confidence. A focus on extensibility and adaptability means that you can respond quickly to the unexpected, without your team losing visibility.

## Documentation

You may wish to skip this page and go directly to the documentation: [The Gort Guide](http://guide.getgort.io/).

## Features

Gort's design philosophy emphasizes flexibility and security by allowing you to:

- Define arbitrary command functionality in any programming language,
- Package those commands into bundles that can be installed in Gort,
- Allow users to trigger commands through Slack or another chat provider and be presented with the output,
- Decide who can use commands (or flags, or parameters) with a built-in RBAC system, and
- Record all activity in an audit log.

Gort lets you build commands in any language you want, using tooling you're already comfortable with, and can tightly control who can use them and how.

<!-- - execute triggered commands anywhere a relay is installed using a tag-based targeting system, -->

## How to Run the Gort Controller

For more information, take a look at the [Quick Start Guide](https://guide.getgort.io/quickstart.html) in [The Gort Guide](https://guide.getgort.io).

## The Gort Client

The `gort` binary also serves as the controller administration CLI.

### Configuring Client Profiles

The `gort` client uses a YAML-formatted configuration file, conventionally
located in the `profile` file in a `.gort` directory in your home directory.
This is where you can store connection credentials to allow `gort` to interact
with the Gort's Controller's REST API.

An example `.gort/profile` file might look like this:

```yaml
defaults:
    profile: gort

gort:
    url: https://gort.mycompany.com:4000
    password: "seekrit#password"
    user: me

preprod:
    url: https://gort.preprod.mycompany.com:4000
    password: "anotherseekrit#password"
    user: me
```

Comments begin with a `#` character; if your password contains a `#`,
surround the entire password in quotes, as illustrated above.

You can store multiple "profiles" in this file, with a different name
for each (here, we have `gort` and `preprod`). Whichever one is noted
as the default (in the `defaults` section) will be used by
`gort`. However, you can pass the `--profile=$PROFILE` option to
`gort` to use a different set of credentials.

While you can add profiles to this file manually, you can also use the
`gort profile create` command to help.

### Getting Help

The `gort` executable contains a number of commands and sub-commands.
Help is available for all of them by passing the `--help` option.
Start with `gort --help`, and go from there.
